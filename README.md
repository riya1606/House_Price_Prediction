# House Price Prediction
### Prerequisite: 
In order to directly get the data from kaggle into your google colab notebook you can run a few commands as mentioned in the notebook. You also need to access **Kaggle API key**. You can obtain your API key by logging into Kaggle, going to your account settings, and generating a new API key. Download the API key file (usually named "kaggle.json"). Upload this file into your session and replace your username and API_key.

### Description:
In this project, we have harnessed the **Melbourne Housing Market** dataset from Kaggle, a comprehensive and rich source of real estate data, to develop a robust predictive model. The primary goal is to assist homebuyers, sellers, and investors in making informed decisions by predicting house prices with high precision.

### Key Project Steps:
- Data Collection and Preprocessing: We began by collecting the Melbourne Housing Market dataset, which includes historical sales data. We then meticulously cleaned, transformed, and preprocessed the data to ensure its quality and suitability for our model.
- Feature Engineering: Feature engineering played a pivotal role in enhancing our model's predictive capabilities. We extracted relevant information from the dataset, created new features, and selected the most influential variables to improve model performance.
- Model Selection: After extensive experimentation, we chose the Gradient Boosting Regressor as our predictive model due to its excellent performance in terms of accuracy and robustness.
- Training and Evaluation: We split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate our model's performance. 
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning the model's hyperparameters was a critical step in optimizing its performance. 
- Deployment: Our model is ready for deployment, making it accessible to users who want to obtain accurate price predictions for Melbourne properties. Whether you are a prospective buyer, seller, or investor, our model can assist you in making well-informed decisions.

### Performance:
It has an accuracy of 98.23%
